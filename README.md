# ANATOLIA PV Yield Anomaly Detection & Forecasting

This repository contains a complete end-to-end workflow for:

Training data generation from PV plant SCADA, satellite (SARAH) and reanalysis (ERA5-Land) datasets.

Model training of an LSTM-based autoencoder for anomaly detection in plant energy yield.

Real-time inference: daily forecasting (with GFS) and online anomaly detection on live plant data.
